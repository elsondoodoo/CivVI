Civ VI beta

generate random map of hexagon grids, each hexagon has different terrain:

grassland (gives 1 rice, movement cost 1)

forest (gives 1 wood, movement cost 2)

mountain (gives 1 stone, movement cost 2)

players can build cities, cities grow (10 * population multiplier) population from each rice on adjacent grassland tiles within a 3 hexagon radius per turn

for each 2 population, the city can generate (1 * market multiplier) gold per turn

for each 50 population, the city can generate (1 * monument multiplier) culture per turn

for each 50 population, the city can generate (1 * library multiplier) science per turn

for each 100 population, the city can upgrade 1 level

Cities can generate troops, which can move around the map and be used to attack other cities and troops:

types of troops: 

Scouts (1 range, 2 damage, 10 health, 5 movement, 20 gold cost (instantly trians) or takes (3 - city level) turns),

archers (2 range, 3 damage, 5 health, 2 movement, 70 gold cost (instantly trians) or takes (7 - city level) turns)

players can upgrade cities with buildings, with each building giving different effects

Monument: built with 200 stone and 50 wood, which gives population multiplier = 1.2 and culture multiplier = 1.5

Market: built with 100 wood and 200 rice, which gives population multiplier = 1.2 and gold multiplier = 1.5

Library: built with 100 wood, 50 rice and 100 stone, which gives population multiplier = 1.2 and science multiplier = 1.5

Three ways to win:
